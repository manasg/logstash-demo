If we have one pattern. 1 out of 3 lines match the pattern. 2 will show grokparsefailure as a tag.

pattern spec in conf - contains 3 patterns - so no more grokparse failure

lets try dropping one


----

even if grok parse failure is done - the log still makes it! but no tags/fields!

-----

if a log file contains two different types of logs - and you create separate grok filters - you will get grok parse failure because, at any time - 1 filter won't match the other line

--- 

the line would still make it to wherever you want it to go - (elastic search) - but will have the bad tag!

-----

i have 2 grok filters now and i pass 2 log lines through.
console will show 2 grok parse failures
how many go to elastic search?
just 2! 
Its a sequential run of filters with additions.

First grok filter - parses it correctly, adds the fields
The next one can't parse it - so adds grok parse failure as a tagâ€¦ BUT if we should not use grep to drop it!

Essentially if a log file has two TYPEs of logs - we need to be creative in our patterns/ especially if we want to index on fields!
